Step 1 Prepare the egg mixture
Beat the eggs, milk and sugar in a large bowl till the sugar dissolves in the mixture.

Step 2 Soak the bread slices in egg mixture
Soak the bread slices one by one in the mixture and coat them well.

Step 3 Fry the soaked bread slices
Place a frypan over medium flame and add butter in it. Once the butter melts, put a soaked bread slice and fry it for a minute.

Flip and fry the other side of the bread slice. Repeat the process for all the bread slices. You can garnish the Sweet Bread Toast with maple syrup. Serve hot.
